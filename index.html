                        for reduction of video and audio records. Our team were able to successfully
                        implement this feature, which added value to the project and helped achieve its

                        Configured SonarQube for numbers (20+) of environments. Configuring SonarQube
                        environments involves setting up the tool to work effectively with a project's
                        codebase, ensuring that it's able to accurately identify issues and provide useful
                        feedback. It helps to ensure that the tool works consistently across different stages
                        of the project.

                        Estimation of large-scale solutions from the scratch. It was a challenging task that
                        requires a deep understanding of the project requirements, available resources, and
                        potential roadblocks. I am using various estimation techniques, such as the use of
                        historical data, expert judgment, and parametric models, to accurately predict the
                        resources required for the project.
